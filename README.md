# Project Overview

This project focuses on **text-to-image generation** using both prebuilt and custom models. The objective is to perform a **comparative analysis** of these models across various tasks using both **quantitative** and **qualitative** metrics. The implementation includes generating images based on text prompts and evaluating the results using different evaluation criteria.

## Video Submission Issue

Unfortunately, due to the **Coursera upload limit** and **poor internet connection**, I was unable to upload the project demonstration video directly to the platform. Despite **scaling down** the video multiple times, it still exceeded the file size limit. As a workaround, I have uploaded the video to **GitHub** instead. You can access the video via the following link: [[GitHub Video Link](https://github.com/yassinnawar/TextToImage_BSc/blob/main/Final_Project%20Video_480.mov)]()

## Model Upload Limitation

I had initially planned to upload the **trained models** as part of this project. However, each model is approximately **800 MB**, and GitHub's file size limit of **100 MB** makes it impossible to include them here.
